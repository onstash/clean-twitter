# Clean Twitter

This extension aims to clean up Twitter's desktop web UI by removing annoying things like "Who to follow", "Trending now", etc, by default. Opinionated at the moment.

* Removes "Trends" left sidebar
* Removes user profile sidebar in the feed view
* Removes "Moments" from nav-bar
* Adds "Likes" to nav-bar
